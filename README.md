# HTML CSS Portfolio Page for Barry Lui

## Description 

This webpage holds the content for my portfolio. It has been built largely by myself having replaced most of the starter code to support my custom webpage skeleton. It has been a great opportunity for me to apply the knowledge learned over the course of week 2 to build a webpage using CSS Flexboxes, CSS Grids and also implementing media queries to follow best practices.

Following this task, I've certainly enhanced my skills to wireframe and then write HTML and CSS code to build a site that aligns with my wireframe.

One of the challenges I'd like to overcome is understanding how to make things work properly across different browsers. I noticed on Firefox, my webpage looks slightly different to how it does on Safari and Chrome. Additionally, there are challenges around using a Fixed position for navigation bars as it appears to cause content to appear under it. For the purpose of this project, I've worked around this with a 'spacer div' but it isn't optimal as content links appear to take you a bit too low (even though they are behaving as expected).
